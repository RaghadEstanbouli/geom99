  <h1>Example error embedding (iFrame) on Google MyMaps: <i>X-Frame_options set to sameorigin</i> error</h1>
  <h2>failing iframe:</h2>
  <p>Here is a MyMap showing data from the Fleming China Great Wall Hike in October 2016. The first example fails and the second works. View-source (CTRL-V or right-click) to see the URLs used. The solution is at the bottom.</p>
<iframe id="errorid"" src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1RtLOehNImRBoLOxm8wN_gq4Z5Ok&usp=sharing" title="Google MyMaps">
</iframe>
  <h2>working iframe:</h2>
<iframe id="worksid" src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1RtLOehNImRBoLOxm8wN_gq4Z5Ok&usp=sharing" title="Google MyMaps">
</iframe>
  <h2>Solution Description</h2>
  <p>The top URL has refused to display in a frame because Google set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'sameorigin' for this document. Many websites do not want you to embed their website into theirs and this is a way to protect/prevent it.</p>
  <p>The URL used must not be the "edit" one for the document. Google MyMaps (like most cloud resources) uses an "ID" for the document name. The above document's ID is 1RtLOehNImRBoLOxm8wN_gq4Z5Ok.</p>
  <p>An application (in the top case editing a mymap) "consumes" this MyMaps document and provides the GUI around it. In the topmost example it uses the "edit" app. The bottom example uses the "embed" app, which does allow iFrame use. Modify your URL to be "embed" from "edit" and it will work!</p>
